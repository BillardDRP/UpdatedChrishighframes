# UpdatedChris-Highframes
###Chris' highframes updated with more cusomizations

# Chris' other cfgs are soon to come

## NOTE: I did not create the bulk of the cfg, I am simply updating them in chris' absence
### The original cfgs can be found [here](https://chrisdown.name/tf2/)

# Editing:
### You MUST use a code editor that does not format text, my recommendations are:
#### Mac: [Atom](atom.io) or [Sublime Text 2/3](http://www.sublimetext.com)
#### Windows [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [Sublime Text 2/3](http://www.sublimetext.com)

#Installing CFG
### Mac:
Navigate to <code>username/Library/Application Support/Steam/Steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/cfg</code> and drop in autoexec.cfg
# Make it work:
After installing, open Steam and open your game library. Then right-click on Team Fortress 2 and click on properties and enter <code>-dxlevel 81 -full -w WIDTH -h HEIGHT -console -novid -useforcedmparms -noforcemaccel -noforcemspd</code> to if you play in fullscreen or <code>-dxlevel 81 -sw -w WIDTH -h HEIGHT -console -noborder -novid -useforcedmparms -noforcemaccel -noforcemspd</code> if you use windowed. Note: replace width/height with your screen res. Then launch/quit TF2 real quick.
Then go back into properties and remove <code>dxlevel 81</code>.
